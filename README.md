# crapGX
every thought if the browsers these days are getting too good?
think again

crapGX is like your normal browser. Tabs and URL bars and all of that. But, its unique in a few ways.

1. Wanna delete a tab? too bad <br>
   Yeah. I didn't have tab deleting since I was kinda buzy plus its 1 AM at the time of typing.<br>
   Note: I actually added the tab functionality(with some help from Chat GPT) but god it looks awful
3. Better not misstype!<br>
   No typos allowed
4. Too much tabs? time to learn how to side scroll<br>
   CLUE: its shift + scroll
5. You like OOP? no <br>
   all this is in one file so no external js or css.
6. no more cookies<br>
   dont eat them.  they are bad for ur teeth(and for my sanity)<br>

NOTE: after stealing like 50% of my code from Chat GPT, now i have browsing history here(I think)
